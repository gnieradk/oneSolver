To see a short report summarizing the benchmark run:
chmod +c ./report.sh 
and then
./report.sh

Description:
- chimera_dropletns - orginal chimera droplets instances (Ising format) from Ref. [1] (available in [2]).

- chimera_dropletns_qbsolv - chimera droplets instances (qbsolve format) used by this solver.

- results - output generated by this solver and the reference solutions found by the tensor. 
            network based solver from Ref. [1] (see also [2])

- scripts - scripts to convert instances from Ising to QUBO format, and merge all CSV files.

- plot.py - compares solutions for different system sizes and two temperature schedules.


Info:
The actual results for 001.txt instance were obtained using: 
- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6950X CPU @ 3.00GHz with 32GB memory.
